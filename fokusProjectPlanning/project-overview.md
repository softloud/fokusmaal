# Project Overview

## Objective

Let *focus* be time spent with a specific intention. 

> Am I achieving my desired balance of focus in life?

Productivity is not a constant, but a variable with a distribution. 

Some days we get some things done. Or we might characterise our productivity as a solid day's work. Sometimes we get nothing done. And, some days, the best days, we hit flow. 

Flow is not an attribute to be summoned, but a muscle that requires exercise. Flow is a practice that works in synergy with the practice of work or creativity. 

We will have good days, okay days, bad days, and excellent days. A further condition is these are not in equal measure; we need to feel happy with the proportion of productivity. Ideally, we wish to have mostly good days, allowing for a fair chunk of okay days. We also wish to minimise the bad and okay days. Through practice we build focus to find more and more excellent days.  

If all we can truly own in this life is time, what matters most is how we spend it.
